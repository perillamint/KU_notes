# Performance
## Measuring performance
* CPU Execution time
  * The actual time the CPU spends computing for a specific task
* User CPU time
  * The CPU time spent in a program itself
* System CPU time
  * The CPU time spent in the operating system performing tasks.

## CPU performance and factors
## Instruction performance
* Clock cycle per instruction
* Instruction per cycle

## The power wall
* Dynamic Energy
Capacitive load * Voltage^2
* Dynamic Power
Capacitive load * Voltage^2 * Frequency switched
Capacitive load * Voltage^2 * Activity Factor * Frequency
# Metrics
* Energy Delay Product
* Energy Delay Square Product

# Circuit-level optimization
* Clock-gating
  * Cut off clock signal
* Power-gating
  * Cut off power

# Uniprocessors to Multiprocessors
* Single-core touches power wall.

# Fallacies and Pitfalls
