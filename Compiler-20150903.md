# What is compiler?
* Translates programming langage(source language) to other language(taget language).
  * Typically, source language is a high-level language (e.g. C, C++, Java)
  * The target language is a machine-language (e.g. IA-32 opcode)

## A fundamental requirement
* The compiler SHOULD preserve the meaning of the source program.
  * source programs output SHOULD be same as target programs output.

Note: Sometimes, compiler MAY do some enhancements.

# Structure of modern compilers
* source program translated into IR using front end and passes Optimizer.
* Back end translates IR into target language.

## "Verifying compilers" (A grand challenge in CS)
* After optimizer, verifier kicks in and verify IR and emit Error.

# Front end
* Lexical analyzer gets character stream and tokenize it.
* Syntax analyzer gets streams of token and build syntax tree
* IR translator gets syntax tree and emits IR.

## Lexical analyzer
* Tokenize stream of characters.

## Syntax analizer
* Parse stream of tokens into syntax tree.

## IR Translator
* Intermediate Representation
  * Lower-level than the source language
  * But, higher-level then the target language.

# In the compiler
## Optimizer
* Transform IR to have better performances
* Chains of optimizer does optimization

# Back end
* Generates the target machine code.
* Translate given IR into target machine code.

# Summary
* A modern compiler consists of three phases:
  * The front end understands source program.
  * The optimizer improves the quality of the program.
  * The back end generates the target program.
